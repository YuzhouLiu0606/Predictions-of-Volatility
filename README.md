### Predictions of Volatility

Stock market investment is just another synonym for ‘risk and return’, the accurate and timely prediction of market volatility remains one of the most challenging problems. In this project, we are given features for the evolution of the limit order book over one-year period for 6 stocks to explore machine learning methods in volatility classification problem. We develop an experimental framework to predict next volatility label. First, we explore the distribution of these features, as well as the diurnal pattern of the volatilities of each stock. Meanwhile, we will explore the effectiveness of five different models in predicting future volatility labels based on past information. Among all the models we built, XGBoost turns out to be the most effective one, which is selected for further prediction and test.
